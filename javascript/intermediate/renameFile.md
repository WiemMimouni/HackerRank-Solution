**Problem Statement:**
You want to rename a file on your computer, but you can only delete characters from the original file name. The new file name must be a subsequence of the original file name. You need to find how many ways you can create the new file name by just removing characters.

**Function Signature:**

```javascript
function renameFile(newName, oldName) => number
```

**Input:**

- `newName` (String): The desired new file name.
- `oldName` (String): The original file name.
- The length of `oldName` is between 1 and 10^5.

**Output:**

- Returns an integer denoting the number of ways to find `newName` within `oldName` modulo 10^9+7.

**Constraints:**

- The number of ways can be large, so return the answer modulo 10^9+7.

**Implementation:**

1. Initialize two variables, `newNameLength` to store the length of `newName`, and `oldNameLength` to store the length of `oldName`.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(newNameLength + 1) x (oldNameLength + 1)` and initialize all values to 0. This array will be used for dynamic programming.
3. Initialize `MOD` to 10^9+7, which will be used for modulo arithmetic.
4. Loop through `i` from 0 to `newNameLength` and `j` from 0 to `oldNameLength`.
5. If `i` is 0, set `dp[i][j]` to 1 because there is only one way to choose an empty subsequence from `oldName`.
6. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is not 0, compare `newName[i-1]` with `oldName[j-1]`. If they are equal, set `dp[i][j]` to the sum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
7. Set `dp[i][j]` to the sum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`.
8. Finally, return `dp[newNameLength][oldNameLength] % MOD` as the number of ways to find `newName` within `oldName`.

**Example:**

```javascript
const newName = "CCC";
const oldName = "CCCCC";
const result = renameFile(newName, oldName);
console.log(result); // Output: 10
```

In this example, there are 10 ways to find "CCC" within "CCCCC" by deleting characters, so the function returns 10 modulo 10^9+7.
