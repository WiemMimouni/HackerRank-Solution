**Problem Statement:**
Several points along the highway require repair, and there are an equal number of repair crews stationed at various points along the highway. Each crew must be assigned to a specific repair job, and we want to minimize the total distance traveled by all crews before they can begin work.

**Function Signature:**

```javascript
function getMinCost(crewIds, jobIds) => number
```

**Input:**

- `crewIds` (Array of integers): Represents the positions of repair crews.
- `jobIds` (Array of integers): Represents the positions of repair jobs.
- `n` (Integer): The number of elements in `crewIds` and `jobIds`. (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- Each element in `crewIds` and `jobIds` satisfies: 1 ≤ id ≤ 10^9

**Output:**

- Returns the minimum possible total distance traveled by all crews as an integer.

**Constraints:**

- The length of `crewIds` and `jobIds` is the same.

**Implementation:**

1. Sort the `crewIds` and `jobIds` arrays in ascending order.
2. Initialize a variable `totalDistance` to 0 to keep track of the total distance traveled.
3. Iterate through the sorted `crewIds` and `jobIds` arrays in parallel.
4. For each pair of crew and job positions, calculate the absolute difference between them, and add it to `totalDistance`.
5. Return `totalDistance` as the minimum possible total distance traveled.

**Example:**

```javascript
const crewIds = [5, 3, 1, 4, 6];
const jobIds = [9, 3, 1, 15, 8];
const result = getMinCost(crewIds, jobIds);
console.log(result); // Output: 17
```

In this example, the function assigns crew positions to job positions in a way that minimizes the total travel distance, resulting in a total distance of 17.
